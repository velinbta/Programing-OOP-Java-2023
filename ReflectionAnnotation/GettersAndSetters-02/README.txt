2. Getters and Setters
Import "Reflection.java" in your project.
Use reflection to get all Reflection methods.
Then prepare an algorithm that will recognize, which methods are getters and setters.

Sort each collection alphabetically by methods names. Print to console each getter on a new line in the format:
"{name} will return class {Return Type}" 
Then print all setters in the format:
"{name} and will set field of class {Parameter Type}"

Output:
getEmail will return class java.lang.String
getName will return class java.lang.String
getWebAddress will return class java.lang.String
getZip will return class int
setEmail and will set field of class java.lang.String
setName and will set field of class java.lang.String
setWebAddress and will set field of class java.lang.String
setZip and will set field of class int
