1. Person 
Create a package person.
You are asked to model an application for storing data about people.
You should be able to have a Person and a Child.
The child derives from the person. Every person has a name and an age.
The Person class also has getters for the fields.

Create a Child class that inherits Person and has the same public constructor definition.
However, do not copy the code from the Person class - reuse the Person class's constructor.

Input:
First line - name
Second line - age

Examples:

Input 1:
Peter
13 

Output 1:
Peter
13

Input 2:
George
10

Output 2:
George
10
