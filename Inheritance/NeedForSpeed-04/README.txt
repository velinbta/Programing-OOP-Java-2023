4. Need for Speed 
Create the following hierarchy with the following classes: 

Vehicle
Motorcycle <- Vehicle
RaceMotorcycle <- Motorcycle
CrossMotorcycle <- Motorcycle

Car <- Vehicle
FamilyCar <- Car
SportCar <- Car

Create a base class Vehicle. It should contain the following members:
DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION - final static double (constant)
fuelConsumption - double
fuel - double
horsePower - int
Getters and Setters for the fields
A public constructor which accepts (fuel, horsePower) and set the default fuel consumption on the field fuelConsumption
void drive (double kilometers)

The drive method should have the functionality to reduce the fuel based on the traveled kilometers and fuel consumption.
Keep in mind that you can drive the vehicle only if you have enough fuel to finish the driving.
The default fuel consumption for Vehicle is 1.25. Some of the classes have different default fuel consumption:
SportCar - DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION = 10
RaceMotorcycle - DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION = 8
Car - DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION = 3
