2. Shapes 
Create class hierarchy, starting with abstract class Shape:

Fields:
perimeter: Double
area: Double

Encapsulation for these fields
Abstract methods:
calculatePerimeter()
calculateArea()

Extend Shape class with two children:
Rectangle
Circle

Each of them needs to have:
Fields:
For Rectangle
height: Double
width: Double 
For Circle
radius: final Double

Encapsulation for these fields
Public constructor 
Concrete methods for calculations (perimeter and area)
